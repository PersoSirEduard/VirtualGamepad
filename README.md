# Virtual Gamepad

### Description
Virtual Gamepad is mainly a Windows desktop solution that allows its users to create a virtual Xbox controller device that can then be controlled and mapped by keyboard inputs. On a person note, I created this application to enable friends on Steam to remote play with me while not owning any controllers at home (yeah crazy, can you believe that?!).

### Installation
**WARNING: This application may still contain a few bugs since I quickly made it.**

1) Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/PersoSirEduard/VirtualGamepad/releases).
2) Open the executable to install the application.
3) Visit the path of installation of the application and install the driver `ViGEmBusSetup_x64.msi`.
4) Restart the application.
5) Enjoy.

### How to use
You can select an Xbox360 controller input and then assign one or more specific keyboard inputs to it. Any changes on the inputs are taken into consideration immedialtely after change. Finally, configuration schemes can be saved and loaded for later use. To disconnect the virtual controller, the application must be terminated.
